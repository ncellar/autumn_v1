TODO

- make cutting restorable (memo integration)

TODO LATER

- rename ParseOutput to ParseOutcome and ParseResult to ParseTree
- improve choice by passing input directly?
- improve all by passing input directly! then make the parse input a global structure of some kind

NOTES

- precedence is an extremely blunt tool: it precludes memoization!
    - it also increases complexity (??)
- overhead of making everything potentially left-recursive
