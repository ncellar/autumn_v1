TODO

- debug parsing of own project files
    - current issue: when removing the star from whitespace, crash with -1 pos when calling
      literal; try to find where this -1 is set
    - next: why can't I

- make cutting restorable (memo integration)

- check to-do in sequence

- error handler: check if things need to be reset beforehand?

TODO LATER

- rename ParseInput to ParseState
- make config purely descriptive (reusable)
- retool Trace for added flexibility
- retool InstrumentExpression to extract common pattern

NOTES

- precedence is an extremely blunt tool: it precludes memoization!
    - it also increases complexity (??)
- overhead of making everything potentially left-recursive
