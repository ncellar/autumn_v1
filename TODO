--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO

- resolve git issues
    - look at why "sub-repos" appear modified
    - only a problem of stash?
    - try if things work with github (not working with bitbucket)

    - don't forget receive.denyCurrentBranch = warn ing .gitconfig (or .git/config ?)
    - don't forget core.filemode = false in .git/config

- tree building into the grammar!
    - introduce capture notation
    - annotate java grammar with captures

- why inPlace & readOnly give different results on printer (grammar or not)

- make output changes hookable

- make reset hookable

TODO FURTHER SMALL

- pretty printing
    - add an option to cutoff at named expressions
    - add an option to display the name

- path-like getters for parsing expression graphs

- automatically tokenize litterals

- improve diagnostics ("unexpected X" ?)
    - round up tokens definitions

- check that named alternates are only used on allow and forbid clauses

- well formedness check (ford: WF -- can't loop without consuming)

- re-allow memoization when dropping precedence in both schemes

- copy via tree walk (use in feature tests)

- think about group conundrum (should it be a parsing expression?)

TODO GUI

- make it so that the cursor over scrollbars isn't a text cursor

- don't "blue-en" on click, but only on run

TODO FURTHER BIG

- better error handling

- better memo handling

- trees: topological sort

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO MUCH LATER

- make dumb expression faster via a backtracking DPDA
- parser generator?
- think about how a parser could be retooled to parser html
  (which is lax in syntax) -> need to define bounding boxes

OLD IDEAS

- token memo
- unique memo

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APPLICATIONS

- graph constraining language
- pcap filtering language

IDEAS (NETWORK)

- FRP to enact real-time changes

- data plane processing
    - composition
    - check safety properties (forwarding, latency bounds)

- active networks (bytecode in packets)

- versioning: transition/hand-over between states
    - ensure some properties during the transition (atomic updates?)

IDEAS (OTHER)

- meta-checking: check that linguistic extensions satisfy properties
- lookup island grammars
