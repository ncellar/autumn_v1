TODO

DEBUGGER
    - copyOnWrite walk does not work with reference resolver or left detection detector
    - copyOnWrite uses clone, but then setChild can unfortunately write both

    ==> use copier always? more economical anyways...

    - reference resolutions and names
    - Whitespace class: resolve references
    - remove walks side-effects on grammar?

    - allow options in grammar files, namely for root and whitespace spec
    - must invoke parser with parseinput & config options
    - tags ordering issue (stmtexpression in example)

GUMPTION
    - insert $ in Java8 (rule-level only) (-> 544)

TODO PLANNING

4 weeks + 1 (try to interleave):

w1: parse tree etc  (over)
w2: GUI model
w3: GUI
w4: presentation
w5: manual

TODO FURTHER SMALL

- well formedness check (ford: WF -- can't loop without consuming)

- scoped memoization
    - MemoScope
    - ScopedMemo

- tokenizers
    - token PE linked to a tokenizer + type
    - memoization window around position
    - error handling: an error over a token can become "unexpected X"
    - advantage: handles reserved identifiers

- syntax for custom operators ($name?)

TODO FURTHER BIG

- better support for layering with smart tree-building that automatically rewrites trees
  (see D5)

- trees: topological sort

- mini type system for captures? automatic AST classes generation?

- think about building in validation rules

- grammar composition & parameterization

- rule analysis

TODO MUCH LATER

- make dumb expression faster via a backtracking DPDA

- think about how a parser could be retooled to parse html
  (which is lax in syntax) -> need to define bounding boxes

- applications: semi-parsing, JIT
