TODO

- fix accumulating tags in cluster bug

- capture & ownPrintableData ?

- why inPlace & readOnly give different results on printer (grammar or not)

- make output changes hookable

- make reset hookable

- introduce a mini-type system for captures

- syntactic support for naming a capture after the name of identifier used (dollar)

- "marker" capture (capture on its own, no depth increase) (noop expression)

TODO FURTHER SMALL

- pretty printing
    - add an option to cutoff at named expressions
    - add an option to display the name
    - as a tree via visitors

- copy via tree walk (use in feature tests)

- check how grammar grammar might be improved via new capture system

- clean up the compat layer for the capture system
    - better construction through capture methods?

- changes = oldChanges in !leftRecursive condition in expression cluster?

- path-like getters for parsing expression graphs

- check that named alternates are only used on allow and forbid clauses

- well formedness check (ford: WF -- can't loop without consuming)

- re-allow memoization when dropping precedence in both schemes

- think about group conundrum (should it be a parsing expression?)

- source: start from 0 or 1; tab as x chars

- dumb (%) and token (symbol? ^?) operators

- syntax for custom operators ($name?)

- tags as key-value pairs
    - rename value() to text()
    - use value() to fetch the value of a tag

- modify precedence of capture so that (X* # name) becomes valid

- better way to exclude reserved identifiers or warn about them

TODO FURTHER BIG

- better error handling
    - "unexpected X" via rounding up token definitions?

- better memo handling
    - memoize tokens?
    - discard children memo when parent finishes

- trees: topological sort

- rewrite GUI in Swing

TODO MUCH LATER

- make dumb expression faster via a backtracking DPDA

- think about how a parser could be retooled to parser html
  (which is lax in syntax) -> need to define bounding boxes
