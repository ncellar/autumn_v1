TODO

CLUSTER
    - use groups as separate independant parsing expressions?
        - also print precedence!
    - check that named alternates are only used on allow and forbid clauses

CAPTURE SYSTEM
    - rethink system?
    - tags as key-value pairs?
        - rename value() to text()
        - use value() to fetch the value of a tag
    - fix accumulating tags in cluster bug
    - introduce a mini-type system for captures
    - syntactic support for naming a capture after the name of identifier used (dollar)
    - "marker" capture (capture on its own, no depth increase) (noop expression)
    - improve GrammarGrammar using capture system
    - clean up the compat layer for the capture system

HOOKING
    - make output changes hookable
    - make reset hookable
    - syntax for custom operators ($name?)

TODO FURTHER SMALL

- path-like getters for parsing expression graphs

- well formedness check (ford: WF -- can't loop without consuming)

- re-allow memoization when dropping precedence in both schemes

- source: start from 0 or 1; tab as x chars

- dumb (%) and token (symbol? ^?) operators

- modify precedence of capture so that (X* # name) becomes valid

- better way to exclude reserved identifiers or warn about them

TODO FURTHER BIG

- better error handling
    - "unexpected X" via rounding up token definitions?

- better memo handling
    - memoize tokens?
    - discard children memo when parent finishes

- trees: topological sort

- rewrite GUI in Swing

TODO MUCH LATER

- make dumb expression faster via a backtracking DPDA

- think about how a parser could be retooled to parser html
  (which is lax in syntax) -> need to define bounding boxes
