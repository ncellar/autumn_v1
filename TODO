TODO

- tree building into the grammar!
    - make grammar use cluster
        - write expression printer tree walk
        - debug
        - cleanup
    - introduce capture notation
    - annotate java grammar with captures

- retool the expression cluster to hold precedence parsing expression (or group?)

- why inPlace & readOnly give different results on printer (grammar or not)

- make output changes hookable

- make reset hookable

TODO FURTHER SMALL

- pretty printing as tree walking
    - enable non-recursive full-tree printing

- path-like getters for parsing expression graphs

- automatically tokenize litterals

- improve diagnostics ("unexpected X" ?)
    - round up tokens definitions

- check that named alternates are only used on allow and forbid clauses

- well formedness check (ford: WF -- can't loop without consuming)

- re-allow memoization when dropping precedence in both schemes

TODO GUI

- make it so that the cursor over scrollbars isn't a text cursor

- don't "blue-en" on click, but only on run

TODO FURTHER BIG

- better error handling

- better memo handling

- trees: topological sort

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO MUCH LATER

- make dumb expression faster via a backtracking DPDA
- parser generator?
- think about how a parser could be retooled to parser html
  (which is lax in syntax) -> need to define bounding boxes

OLD IDEAS

- token memo
- unique memo

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APPLICATIONS

- graph constraining language
- pcap filtering language

IDEAS (NETWORK)

- FRP to enact real-time changes

- data plane processing
    - composition
    - check safety properties (forwarding, latency bounds)

- active networks (bytecode in packets)

- versioning: transition/hand-over between states
    - ensure some properties during the transition (atomic updates?)

IDEAS (OTHER)

- meta-checking: check that linguistic extensions satisfy properties
- lookup island grammars
