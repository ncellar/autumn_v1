TODO



TODO GRAPH

- improve documentation
- use slots in every callback?
- plan for copy construction via slots

TODO GUI

- make it so that the cursor over scrollbars isn't a text cursor
- don't "blue-en" on click, but only on run

TODO SHOULD

- make output changes hookable
- make reset hookable

TODO NICETIES

- automatically tokenize litterals
- improve diagnostics ("unexpected X" ?)
    - round up tokens definitions
- check that named alternates are only used on allow and forbid clauses
- print expressions only with recursion as names
- well formedness check (ford: WF -- can't loop without consuming)
- re-allow memoization when dropping precedence in both schemes

TODO FURTHER

- tree building into the grammar!

TODO UX

- think about entry points
- let user register own passes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO PAPER

- cite pure and declarative syntax definition
- cite Left Recursion in Parsing Expression Grammars
- mention semantic actions
- must cite Left Recursion in Parsing Expression Grammars
- mention no memoization inside expressions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO MUCH LATER

- make dumb expression faster via a backtracking DPDA
- parser generator?
- think about how a parser could be retooled to parser html
  (which is lax in syntax) -> need to define bounding boxes

OLD IDEAS

- token memo
- unique memo

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APPLICATIONS

- graph constraining language
- pcap filtering language

IDEAS (NETWORK)

- FRP to enact real-time changes

- data plane processing
    - composition
    - check safety properties (forwarding, latency bounds)

- active networks (bytecode in packets)

- versioning: transition/hand-over between states
    - ensure some properties during the transition (atomic updates?)

IDEAS (OTHER)

- meta-checking: check that linguistic extensions satisfy properties
- lookup island grammars
